# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and a comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")

print("Hello!")
# print("Hello!") I was right. When I ran this, it only printed 1 Hello! not 2.
