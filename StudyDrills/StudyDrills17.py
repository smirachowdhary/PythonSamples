# This script is really annoying. There’s no need to ask you before doing the copy, and it prints too much out to the screen. Try to make the script more friendly to use by removing features.
# Done.
# See how short you can make the script. I could make this one line long.
# Done.
# Notice at the end of the What You Should See section I used something called cat? It’s an old command that concatenates files together, but mostly it’s just an easy way to print a file to the screen. Type man cat to read about it.
# Done.
# Find out why you had to write out_file.close() in the code.
# Because you are closing the file.

# Done.
